Account takeover happens when a fraudster gets control of your account, changes the password, contacts, and other personal information to make unauthorized transactions without your knowledge.
<br><br>
One common method is credential stuffing where a fraudster tries to use stolen credentials to a legitimate website. This is possible if you use the same username and password across multiple sites.
<br><br>
Another method is â€œcredential crackingâ€ or intelligent guessing of credentials obtained from your basic personal information.
<br><br>
